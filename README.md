# Design

A basic repository for notes and discussions which will spawn open source projects and items. These will grow into a road map and star map for the overall organization.

## Purpose

Provide a series of federated system of micro-services that allow for processing of the entire procurement to payment major business process.

_**FACET**: Defined_ FACET is an acronym for Federation of Administration and Contract Entitlement Transactions.

## Intended User Base

Large organizations with structured procurement (buying) activities. While the concept draws inspiration from encounters in the United States Federal Government, the business process is equally applicable at the state, local and corporate levels.
